Deep Vision: CIFAR-100 with AlexNet
Overview
This project implements AlexNet, a groundbreaking convolutional neural network, to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. Using PyTorch, the project demonstrates key concepts of deep learning, such as data preprocessing, model architecture modification, training, and evaluation, while adapting AlexNet to handle the smaller images from CIFAR-100.

Features
Model Architecture: AlexNet, modified for CIFAR-100's 100 classes.

Dataset: CIFAR-100, featuring 100 classes of natural images.

Data Augmentation: Resize, normalization, and random flipping for better generalization.

Training Process: Includes detailed training and accuracy reporting across epochs.

Model Saving: Trained model parameters are saved for reuse and deployment.
